# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a tic tac toe project I've made following the Odin Project curriculum. This project is intended as an exercise to learn JS factory functions and the module design pattern. I'm sure there are more elegant solutions out there but I don't follow tutorials outside of the basic outline on the Odin Project's website and I never watch videos or read someone else's code. My code will be rough but I believe I learn best by struggling to brainstorm my own solutions.
